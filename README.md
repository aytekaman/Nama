# Nama

This project is an attempt at creating a simple game engine on OpenGL and C++. It is component based as Unity. It uses Lua for scripting.

This project uses GLFW, Lua, tolua++ (Small library that is used to create bindings between Lua and C++).

I put this project on GitHub for convenience. If you want to try it, you may need to setup dependencies/libs. It is an old project, so you may need the old versions of the mentioned libraries.
